# PropagandaDetection
A machine learning model built for the purpose of propaganda detection inspired by Siddhardhan Project 4.

This was created for my COM 380 final project where we had to supplement computational language theory as of OCT/NOV/DEC 2023. 
This project was created by taking inspiration from Siddhardhan's project 4 video about fake news prediction using machine learning: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nacLBdyG6jE
The project is accompanied by an unnoficial paper about propaganda in language and the detection of such detrimental textual media using machine learning.
